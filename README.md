# InnerCircle Enhancement Suite

This userscript create enhancements for [InnerCircle](https://www.theinnercircle.co/). This repository is hooked up to the [GreaseFork website](https://greasyfork.org/nl/scripts/7700-innercircle-enhancement-suite).

## Features

 * Remove the top question block
 * Hide the matches block when there are no matches to be found
 * Hide invite form
 * Open members in a new tab
 * Load members on hovering over the user-link
 * Night mode

### Load on hover

This is still in beta. Basically, your browser makes a request for this member and pops open a fixed widget at the top left of the screen, with the userinfo in it. This will still count as a view (the user will see you 'visited' their profile)

### Nightmode

This is an enhancement for readability. It changes the colors

## Installation

This userscript can be installed with Tampermonkey for Chrome. Should work on Greasemonkey as well, this is still to be tested
