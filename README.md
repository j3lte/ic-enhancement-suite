 * Install one of these addons (TamperMonkey for Chrome or GreaseMonkey for Firefox)
 * Go to the raw userscript
 * Install it!

## Usage

The InnerCircle Enhancement Suite will add a link to the top bar called "Enhance". If you click on it, it will open a modal where you can set the different features. Once you mkae the changes, click "Save and reload". This will reload the page, applying your settings.

## Features

 * Remove the top question block
 * Hide the matches block when there are no matches to be found
 * Hide invite form
 * Hide welcome form
 * Open members in a new tab
 * Load members on hovering over the user-link
 * Night mode
 * Reverse image search the images of a member/gallery
 * Open the full image

### Load on hover

This is still in beta. Basically, your browser makes a request for this member and pops open a fixed widget at the top left of the screen, with the userinfo in it. This will still count as a view (the user will see you 'visited' their profile)

### Nightmode

This is an enhancement for readability. It changes the colors
